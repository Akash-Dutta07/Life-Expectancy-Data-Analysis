## üìÑ **OBJECTIVE**
Life expectancy refers to the average number of years a person is expected to live based on current mortality rates. According to WHO, data analysis of life expectancy data across different nations reveals significant disparities. Here, we conduct a data analysis on the life expectancy data provided by WHO to better understand the impact of healthcare access, economic conditions, and public health policies on different regions.

First, we clean the data by converting the data types of each attribute and filling in any blank or null cells to ensure smooth data analysis. This process is efficiently handled using Power Query in Power BI, allowing us to obtain the desired insights.








## üìÑ**Data Exploration**

Now, we use the report view to do certain Data-visualization and draw certain insights out of it ,to answer the following Year-Wise.


1. Minimum, Maximum and Average life Expectancy  ?
2. Minimum, Maximum and Average BMI ?
3. Measure  of measles,polio,HIV/AIDs,Hepatitis B, Diphtheria by each country  ?
4. Total Expenditure by status?
5. Top 5 countries by under-five deaths by country?
6. Top 3 Countriesinfant deaths





  
## üìù **CONCLUSION**
By examining WHO's life expectancy data, policymakers and healthcare professionals can make informed decisions and discover critical insights. They can identify trends in healthcare access, economic disparities, and the impact of public health interventions across different regions. This analysis helps highlight areas needing improvement and offers data-driven recommendations tailored to specific populations. Ultimately, these insights can enhance global health outcomes, reduce life expectancy disparities, and improve overall quality of life through targeted actions and resource allocation.
